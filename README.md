# Overview Of Project:

All over the world, people borrowed money to purchase home or car, start businesses, purse education for examples. That said, loans are an important part of modern society.<br>
In 2019, more than 19 million Americans had at least one unsecured personal loan.  Personal lending is growing faster than other loan previously state.<br>
But loans  also presents a challenge for banks and other lending institutions. On one hand, they create revenues with the interest they generate, on another hand they represent a risk as the borrower does not repay it and financial institutions will then lose money.<br>
Working for LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we use fin-tech technology to analyze large amounts of data and predict trends to optimize lending.


# Results:

For this analysis we use and analyse results of six different machine-learning models to find out which one will ensure the best predictions risk to whether lend money or not.<br>
Some metrics will give use insights on which algorithm perform the best:

- **Accuracy score:**<br>
  Accuracy is one metric for evaluating classification models. Informally, accuracy is the fraction of predictions our model got right
- **Precision score:**<br>
  Precision is the ability of a classifier not to label an instance positive that is actually negative. For each class, it is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of a true positive and false positive.
- **Recall score:**<br>
Recall is the ability of a classifier to find all positive instances. For each class it is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
